# Identifying Coastal Upwelling from Environmental Variables

This is my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive program from General Assembly. 

---

### Problem Statement

For this project, I'm building a model to identify periods of coastal upwelling off the coast of Oregon using data collected by the Ocean Observatories Initiatve (OOI). I intend to use environmental variables, such as seawater temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, as features in a classification model, and I'll be labeling my target variable using the CUTI upwelling index. The OOI has several instrument packages off the Washington and Oregon coasts; for this project, I'll be focusing on the Oregon Offshore location, located offshore from Newport, Oregon. The instrument packages found here include a surface mooring that has a bulk meteorology package, a shallow profiler that collects data in the upper ~200 meters of the water column, a stationary platform located at a depth of 200 meters, and a deep profiler that collects data in the lower portion of the water column.
